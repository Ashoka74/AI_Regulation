The same than 
<a href="https://github.com/Ashoka74/AI-Regulation-suggestions">the notebook</a>
application but as a Django app

The app should work by itself, you just have to <strong> provide your OpenAI API </strong> and then enter the following command in the terminal from the folder path:

<h3>
manage.py runserver
</h3>

This command will open a Http window.

If this doesn't work;

try:

<h3>
manage.py makemigrations

manage.py migrate

</h3>
